puppet-irc
==========

Description
-----------

A Puppet report handler for sending notifications of failed runs to IRC.

Requirements
------------

* `carrier-pigeon`
* `puppet` (version 2.6.5 and later)

Installation & Usage
--------------------

1.  Install the `carrier-pigeon` gem on your Puppet master

        $ sudo gem install carrier-pigeon

2.  Install puppet-irc as a module in your Puppet master's module
    path.

3.  Update the `irc_server` variable in the `irc.yaml` file with
    your IRC connection details. If you wish to enable an SSL
    connection to your IRC server then set the `irc_ssl` option to
    `true`. If you need to specify a channel password please specify
    the `irc_password` option. If you are getting register_first error
    please specify irc_register_first as true. 
    If you specify the `github_user` and `github_password` options 
    the report processor will create a Gist containing the log output 
    from the run. The Gist will be linked in the IRC notification.
    If you specify the `parsed_reports_dir` option, and have `store` reports
    enabled, a human-readable version of the yaml report will be saved on the
    reportserver, instead of a Gist.

4.  Copy `irc.yaml` to `/etc/puppet`.
    NOTE: Remove any configurations items you're not setting
    if you are using the default file.

5.  Enable pluginsync and reports on your master and clients in `puppet.conf`

        [master]
        report = true
        reports = irc
        ### or if you enable :parsed_reports_dir
        # reports = store,irc
        pluginsync = true
        [agent]
        report = true
        pluginsync = true

6.  Run the Puppet client and sync the report as a plugin
